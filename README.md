# Programmers' Week 20200  <br> Micro-frontends with Webpack module federation and web components

## Starting

This repo hosts submodules with separate repositories for each MFE. To initialize and pull everything correctly, run:

```git submodule update --init```

After that, go into each submodule directory and `npm i` & `npm start` as you would proceed with single project repositories.


## Presentation

A pdf version of the presentation is available on [this repo]().


## Additional resources

Some resources used as source for the talk and building the app.
