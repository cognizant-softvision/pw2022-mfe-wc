# Programmers' Week 20200  <br> Micro-frontends with Webpack module federation and web components

## Starting

This repo hosts submodules with separate repositories for each MFE. To initialize and pull everything correctly, run:

```git submodule update --init```

After that, go into each submodule directory and `npm i` & `npm start` as you would proceed with single project repositories.


## Presentation

A pdf version of the presentation is available [here](https://github.com/cognizant-softvision/pw2022-mfe-wc/blob/main/pw2022-mfe-presentation.pdf)


## Additional resources
